# Entry-Exit Counter

Entry-Exit Counter is a Python program that detects and tracks people entering and exiting a defined region in real-time, providing live counts of both entries and exits. Users have the option to choose between counting the same person multiple times or only counting unique individuals.

## Features
- Real-time detection and tracking of people entering and exiting a defined region.
- Live count display of both entries and exits.
- Option to count the same person multiple times (Same Counts) or only count unique individuals (Unique Counts).

## PROBLEM :
You need to make a program which will detect and track people and give a live count of people entering a user defined region and exiting the region.
You need to take user input whether they want the count of the same person entering and exiting or they want to get unique counts only. 

Example: 
* Case 1: *Unique Counts: A person enter or exit the region should be counted as 1 (in:1 or out:1)* <br>
* Case 2: *Same Counts: Same person enters and exit the region should be counted as 2 (in:1, out:1)*.

Constraints:
1. User input to count unique people or the same person.
2. User input to take region.
3. Allowed to use any YOLO version model.
4. Person Tracking should be real time.

Output:
1. Processed result saved as mp4.
2. Documented code.
3. Explanation of login in pseudo code as a doc file.
